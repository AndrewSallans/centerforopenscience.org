### 3.11 Certain Votes Prohibited

A director’s vote shall not be counted on any matter that might directly or indirectly result in a private inurement to the benefit of such director, and for the purposes of determining the number of votes necessary to decide such a matter, such director shall be deemed not to be present for a meeting or to be voting by written consent with respect to such vote. Each interested director shall make reasonable efforts to recuse himself or herself from any deliberations of the Board or relevant committee that relate to such a matter. By way of example, but not limitation, no director shall participate in a decision to purchase property or services from, or issue a grant of funds to, any organization at which such director is employed, even if such purchase or grant is consistent with the Corporation’s purposes.

The directors may remove for cause or without cause any officer by the affirmative vote of two thirds of the directors, without considering the vote of a director who may also hold the office which is the subject of the vote.

(Every such Member, Director, other officer, employee, agent, or person is hereafter in this Section 6.3 sometimes referred to as the “Individual”).

b. As to any matter disposed of by any compromise payment by the individual pursuant to any consent decree or otherwise, no indemnification either for the said payment or for any other expense or expenses shall be furnished unless such compromise, after notice that it shall involve such indemnification, shall have been approved as in the best interest of the Corporation by (1) a disinterested majority of the directors at the time being in office, (2) a majority of such disinterested directors, if they shall have obtained an opinion in writing of independent legal counsel to the effect that the Individual shall appear to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best interests of the Corporation, or (3) a majority of the disinterested Members of the Corporation.

c. Expenses, including counsel fees, reasonable incurred by the Individual in connection with the defense or disposition of any such action, suit, or other proceeding may, in advance of the final disposition thereof, be paid from time to time by the Corporation upon receipt of an undertaking by the Individual to repay to the Corporation the amounts so paid if he or she shall be adjudicated to be not entitled to indemnification under Virginia law.

d. The right to indemnification shall not be exclusive of or affect any other right or rights of the Individual; and nothing contained herein shall affect any right or rights to indemnification to which the Individual may be entitled by contract with the Corporation or otherwise under law.

### 6.5 Fiscal Year

The fiscal year of the Corporation shall end on the thirtieth (30th) day of December in each year or on such other date as the directors may determine.

## ARTICLE SEVEN
## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST POLICY

### 7.1 Purpose

The purpose of the conflicts of interest policy is to protect the Corporation’s interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the Corporation or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction.  This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflicts of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.

### 7.2 Definitions

a.	Interested Person.  Any director, principal officer, or member of a committee with Board-delegated powers who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.

b.	Financial Interest.  A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment or family:

1.	an ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement,
2.	a compensation arrangement with the Corporation or with any entity or individual with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement, or
3.	a potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Corporation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.  A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest.  A person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the Board or appropriate committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

### 7.3 Procedures

a.	Duty to Disclose.  In connection with any actual or possible conflicts of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of his or her financial interest and must be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with Board-delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.

b.	Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists.  After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, the interested person shall leave the Board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon.  The remaining Board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.

c.	Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest.

1.	An interested person may make a presentation at the Board or committee meeting, but after such presentation, such person shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.
2.	The Board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Corporation’s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable.  In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.

d.	Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy.

1.	If the Board or committee has reasonable cause to believe that a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
2.	If, after hearing the response of the member and making such further investigation as may be warranted in the circumstances, the Board or committee determines that the member has in fact failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

### 7.4  Records of Proceedings

The minutes of the Board and all committees with Board-delegated powers shall contain:

a.	the names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Board’s or committee’s decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed; and

b.	the names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection therewith.

### 7.5 Compensation Committees

a.	A voting member of the Board of Directors who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.

b.	A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.

c.	No voting member of the Board or any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation, either individually or collectively, is prohibited from providing information to any committee regarding compensation.

### 7.6 Annual Statements

Each director, principal officer and member of a committee with Board-delegated powers shall annually sign a statement affirming that such person:

a.	has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,

b.	has read and understands the policy,

c.	has agreed to comply with the policy, and

d.	understands that the Corporation is a charitable organization and that in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

### 7.7 Periodic Reviews

To ensure that the Corporation operates in a manner consistent with its charitable purposes and that it does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its status as an organization exempt from federal income tax, periodic reviews shall be conducted.  The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:

a.	Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm’s length bargaining.

b.	Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the Corporation’s written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit transaction.

### 7.8 Use of Outside Experts

In conducting the periodic reviews provided for in 7.7, the Corporation may, but need not, use outside advisors.  If outside experts are used their use shall not relieve the Board of its responsibility for ensuring that periodic reviews are conducted.
